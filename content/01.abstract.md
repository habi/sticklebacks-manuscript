## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Can we predict evolution?
The three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) is a well-recognized system for understanding adaptation to divergent habitats.
Populations of benthic and limnetic stickleback differ in a number of phenotypic traits that are associated with shifts in dietary specialization.
However, analyses of the structures required for feeding – especially the jaws and complex internal branchial anatomy – requires considerable time and expertise, with destructive sampling and fine dissection skills needed for quantitative analysis.
The advent of µCT and 3D-scanning technology affords non-destructive sampling and an increase the resolution of data available for study, but at the substantial cost of increasing complexity and processing time for each specimen.
To address these concerns, we developed a rapid and semi-automated segmentation and analysis pipeline based around the Biomedisa Image Segmentation platform for investigating three-dimensional morphological adaptation within the three-spined stickleback.
The pipeline includes splitting a multi-specimen scan into regions of interest for each specimen, reconstruction of targeted anatomy, and morphometric analyses.
We then applied this pipeline to a sampling effort encompassing hundreds of samples of divergent benthic and limnetic stickleback populations, showcasing the possibility of using high-throughput scanning data to provide tests of ecological and evolutionary hypotheses.
