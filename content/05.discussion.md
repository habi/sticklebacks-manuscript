- Both *repeatable* and *reproducible* research
- Automated cropping out of single fish from combined scan very efficiently uses machine time.
  Several fish can be scanned together, splitting is performed after the fact, reproducibly and without manual input.
- Combination of methdes cust down on time **a lot**.  
- Biomedisa makes more "extraction" possible. Other biological questions can be answered, too.
